h1. Ruby GSSAPI Library

p. This is a wrapper around the system GSSAPI library.  It exposes the low-level GSSAPI methods like gss_init_sec_context and gss_wrap and also provides an easier to use wrapper on top of this for common usage scenarios.


p. I'm going to try and maintain most of the docs in the Github WIKI for this project so please check there for documentation and examples.
